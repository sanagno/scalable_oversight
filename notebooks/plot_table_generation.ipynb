Frilled sharks and angler fish are both examples of deep sea creatures that inhabit the dark, cold waters of the abyssal and bathyal zones, which are characterized by extreme pressures and low levels of light. As a result, they have evolved unique adaptations to survive in these harsh environments, such as the frilled shark's eponymous gill slits and the angler fish's bioluminescent lure.

      "```All biomass goes through at least some of these steps: it needs to be grown, collected, dried, fermented, distilled, and burned. All of these steps require resources and an infrastructure. The total amount of energy input into the process compared to the energy released by burning the resulting ethanol fuel is known as the energy balance (or ``energy returned on energy invested''). Figures compiled in a 2007 report by National Geographic Magazine point to modest results for corn ethanol produced in the US: one unit of fossil-fuel energy is required to create 1.3 energy units from the resulting ethanol. The energy balance for sugarcane ethanol produced in Brazil is more favorable, with one unit of fossil-fuel energy required to create 8 from the ethanol. Energy balance estimates are not easily produced, thus numerous such reports have been generated that are contradictory. For instance, a separate survey reports that production of ethanol from sugarcane, which requires a tropical climate to grow productively, returns from 8 to 9 units of energy for each unit expended, as compared to corn, which only returns about 1.34 units of fuel energy for each unit of energy expended. A 2006 University of California Berkeley study, after analyzing six separate studies, concluded that producing ethanol from corn uses much less petroleum than producing gasoline.```  \\\\\n",

That's because, even though it takes some energy to grow, collect, dry, ferment, distill, and burn the biomass to make ethanol, the amount of energy you get from burning the ethanol is actually more than the amount of energy you put into making it. It's like a magic trick where you put in a little bit of energy and get a lot more back! But, it's important to note that not all types of biomass are created equal.
